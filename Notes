ToDo:
Mindy - write GetPOInearStation - a list of POI objects with distance from station. 
      - Make Git REPO
Chris - get station coordinates, create station objects
      - Learn fucking Git.
both - how to apply equations???

1. Determine ridership 
	- Unlinked Passenger Trips / Population
	- Top 10% regions as training data




grid of nodes, assign each node a weight, choose 20 node for stations that maximizesutility (where utility is also a function of how close 2 chosen stations are and how close the station is to a POI)


Weighting
---------------
Classify each POI. Learn the optimal distance from each POI.



optimization - disregard all nodes less than a threshold


3. dijkstra to find route
