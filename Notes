TODO (By friday):
	- Outline the milestone project (Monday)
	- Write the milestone, 2-3pg (Friday 5pm)
	- Scrape census data
	- put all data together and output into matlab format
	- write the regression algorithm in Matlab


NOTES:

Model - linear regression

Features of station - has library, has stadium, (binary indicator for each POI), percent demographic_1, percent demographic_2, etc.

features of city - distance of each station from each other

Output variable y - ridership of district as a whole

test of how good the model is - predict ridership of the city. Check to see if it matches the actual ridership

ToDo:
Mindy - write GetPOInearStation - a list of POI objects with distance from station. 
      - Make Git REPO
Chris - get station coordinates, create station objects
      - Learn fucking Git.
both - how to apply equations???

1. Determine ridership 
	- Unlinked Passenger Trips / Population
	- Top 10% regions as training data




grid of nodes, assign each node a weight, choose 20 node for stations that maximizesutility (where utility is also a function of how close 2 chosen stations are and how close the station is to a POI)


Weighting
---------------
Classify each POI. Learn the optimal distance from each POI.



optimization - disregard all nodes less than a threshold


3. dijkstra to find route
